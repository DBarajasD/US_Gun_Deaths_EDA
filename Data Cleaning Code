## Data Cleaning Process

When I began exploring the data I noted that there were a few blank rows in the intent, place, and education columns. I updated the blank rows in the intent column to 'Undetermined'.The blank rows in place were changed to 'Other unspecified'. However, I made no changed to the blank rows in th education column. Below is the code used to make those changes.

-- Updating intent
SELECT DISTINCT intent, count(*)
FROM gun_deaths 
GROUP BY intent;   

UPDATE gun_deaths 
SET intent = 'Undetermined'
WHERE intent = '';

-- Updating Place
SELECT DISTINCT Place, count(*)
FROM gun_deaths
GROUP BY place;

UPDATE gun_deaths
SET place = 'Other unspecified'
WHERE place = '';
