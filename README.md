# Project Overview

My name is Diego Barajas-Diaz and this Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project is based on gun deaths in the United States from the year 2013-2015. This project was completed using MySQL and Tableau. In the project I was able to identify the most common cause of gun deaths and the places where gun deaths occurred the most in those years. Once I completed the data exploration on MySQL, I created a Tableau dashboard to showcase some of my findings.
