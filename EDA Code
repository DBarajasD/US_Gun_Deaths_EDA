Below is the code I used for my Exploratory Data Analysis. 

SELECT *
FROM gun_deaths;

-- Death Count by Year

SELECT year, count(*) as total_deaths
FROM gun_deaths
GROUP BY year;

-- Death count by intent 
SELECT intent, count(*) as death_count
FROM gun_deaths 
GROUP BY intent
ORDER BY death_count DESC;

SELECT year, intent, count(*) as death_count
FROM gun_deaths 
GROUP BY year, intent
ORDER BY intent, year;

-- Gun death by race 
Select race, count(*) as death_count
FROM gun_deaths
GROUP BY race
ORDER BY death_count DESC;

-- Gun death by sex
SELECT sex, count(*) as death_count
FROM gun_deaths 
GROUP BY sex
ORDER BY death_count DESC; 

SELECT intent, count(*) as death_count
FROM gun_deaths 
WHERE sex = 'F'
GROUP BY intent;

SELECT intent, count(*) as death_count
FROM gun_deaths 
WHERE sex = 'M'
GROUP BY intent;

SELECT sex, count(*) as death_count
FROM gun_deaths 
WHERE intent = 'Suicide'
GROUP BY sex;

-- Most common place of death 
SELECT place, count(*) as death_count
FROM gun_deaths 
WHERE intent = 'Suicide'
GROUP BY place
ORDER BY death_count DESC
LIMIT 5;

-- Number of suicides by age group
SELECT 
	CASE 
    WHEN age < 13 THEN 'child'
	WHEN age < 20 THEN 'teenager'
    WHEN age between 20 and 39 THEN 'young_adult'
    WHEN age between 40 and 60  THEN 'middle_age'
    ELSE 'senior_citizen' 
    END as age_group,
    count(*) as death_count
FROM gun_deaths
WHERE intent = 'Suicide' 
GROUP BY age_group
ORDER BY death_count DESC;
